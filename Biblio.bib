    abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y1, y2, ..., yn are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters θ. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of choosing a transformation t(y) of a univariate response variable y so that the regression function E{t(y)∣ x} is linear in the predictor vector x. Let ŷ be the fitted values from a linear regression of y on x. Given a few simple assumptions, we show that the plot with y on the horizontal axis and ŷ on the vertical axis can be used to visualise the needed transformation t(y). A smoother can then be used as an aid to assessing t(y) visually.},
